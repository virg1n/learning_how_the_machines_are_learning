# Learning how the machines are learning

This is my practics to understand how ML is working. 
Before I started writing some of this, I watched Andrej Karpathy's tutorial explaining how it should work, but after that I wrote this code the way I understood it, without copying and pasting it.
All Resources (video-lessons, posts and etc) I'll put here:
